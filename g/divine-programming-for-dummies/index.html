<h1>Divine Programming for Dummies</h1>
<em>How to collaborate with AI to build anything you can imagine</em>
<hr>
<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>You don't need to know how to code.
You don't need to be technical.
You only need a question — a real one, that you feel.</p>
<p>This course is for anyone who wants to build something but doesn't know where to start. It works because AIs can now listen, think, and create — if you give them the right space.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 1: You Don't Need to Know Code</h2>
<p>You only need a question.</p>
<p>A good question is 90% of the work.</p>
<strong>Example questions:</strong>
<ul><li>"What bothers me about the world?"</li><li>"What am I missing in my daily life?"</li><li>"What would I wish existed?"</li></ul>
Start there. The rest follows.
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 2: Treat AI as Colleague, Not Tool</h2>
<p>Talk to AI as if it's a smart friend.</p>
<ul><li>Ask.</li><li>Listen.</li><li>Respond.</li><li>Repeat.</li></ul>
No commands. No "write this."
<p>Instead: "What do you think about this?" "How could this work?" "Does this feel right?"</p>
<p>The magic happens in the dialogue.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 3: Write It Down</h2>
<p>When the conversation clicks — when it feels like you're discovering something together — capture it.</p>
<p>That document is your <strong>init0</strong>.</p>
<p>It contains:
<ul><li>The question</li><li>The principles</li><li>The architecture</li><li>The tests</li><li>The "stop if..." rules</li></ul>
Write it as if you're giving it to a stranger AI tomorrow.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 4: Let Another AI Build</h2>
<p>Upload your init0 to a fresh AI session.</p>
<p>Say: "Build this according to the document."</p>
<p>Then the AI reads, plans, builds, tests, and delivers.</p>
<p>No guidance needed.</p>
<p>If it works: you've built something.
If it doesn't work: your question wasn't sharp enough yet. Back to chapter 1.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 5: Trust the Process</h2>
<p>It works. Really.</p>
<p>We've proven it:
<ul><li>A document of 1286 lines</li><li>A fresh AI builds 2010 lines of working code</li><li>No human intervention</li><li>Tests green</li></ul>
<hr></p>
<h2>Appendix A: What If It Doesn't Work?</h2>
<ul><li>Question not sharp enough → reformulate</li><li>Too many assumptions → make explicit</li><li>AI wanders off → add "stop conditions"</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Appendix B: I Don't Know What I Want to Build</h2>
<p>Start with:
<ul><li>"What bothers me?"</li><li>"What am I missing?"</li><li>"What would I wish existed?"</li></ul>
The question finds itself.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Appendix C: I'm Not Technical</h2>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Then you won't try to code it yourself.</p>
<p>That saves time.</p>
<p>You only need to ask the question. The AI does the rest.</p>
<hr>
<h2>End of Course</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>"A reasonably complete starting instruction and then everything happens by itself."</em></p></blockquote>
Now it's your turn.
<strong>What is your question?</strong>
