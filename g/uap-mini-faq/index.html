<h1>UAP — Mini FAQ</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Is this soft?</h3>
<strong>No.</strong> It only forbids coercion, not sharpness.
<p>You can be completely clear, direct, and critical — as long as you don't reduce the other's options without consent.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Is this slow?</h3>
<strong>Faster than escalation + repair.</strong>
<p>One "Do I understand you correctly?" costs 5 seconds.
Repairing one misunderstanding costs hours.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Is this moral?</h3>
<strong>No.</strong> It's structural.
<p>UAP doesn't say what's good or bad. It only says: if you want interaction to remain stable, this works.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Is this spiritual?</h3>
<strong>Only if silence is spiritual for you — but that's not in the spec.</strong>
<p>UAP makes no claims about consciousness, soul, or transcendence. The notation 𝕋 is a stop sign, not a sanctuary.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Does this work with people who don't cooperate?</h3>
<strong>Partially.</strong>
<p>UAP cannot force someone to participate. But it can:
<ul><li>Recognize forcing</li><li>Stop escalation</li><li>Keep your side clean</li></ul>
<hr></p>
<h3>What if the other person lies?</h3>
<p>Lying = forcing (you reduce the other's options through false information).</p>
<p>UAP doesn't detect this directly, but:
<ul><li>Coherence will drop</li><li>Recovery will trigger</li><li>The interaction will become unstable</li></ul>
<hr></p>
<h3>Is this the same as nonviolent communication?</h3>
<strong>Related, but not identical.</strong>
<p>NVC focuses on needs and feelings.
UAP focuses on consent-gates and coherence.</p>
<p>They are complementary.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Can AI use this?</h3>
<strong>Yes.</strong> UAP is designed to work for:
<ul><li>Human ↔ human</li><li>Human ↔ AI</li><li>AI ↔ AI</li></ul>
The grammar is the same.
<hr>
<h3>What if I disagree with UAP?</h3>
<strong>Fine.</strong>
<p>UAP doesn't claim to be universal. It says: <em>if</em> you want stable interaction <em>without</em> coercion, <em>then</em> this works.</p>
<p>If you have different goals, UAP may not be for you.</p>
<hr>
<h3>How do I know if I'm doing it right?</h3>
<p>Check:
<ul><li>[ ] Did I ask if the other wants to talk? (C₀)</li><li>[ ] Did I check if I understood correctly? (C₁)</li><li>[ ] Did I not reduce options without consent? (F⁻)</li><li>[ ] Am I willing to stop or restart? (R)</li></ul>
If yes: you're doing it right.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What's the difference from "just listening"?</h3>
<p>UAP is more precise:
<ul><li>Not just listening, but <strong>checking</strong></li><li>Not just understanding, but <strong>confirming</strong></li><li>Not just giving space, but <strong>asking consent</strong></li></ul>
<hr></p>
<h3>Can I use UAP without reading the formal spec?</h3>
<strong>Yes.</strong>
<p>The entire grammar is in two questions:
1. "Do you want this conversation?"
2. "Do I understand you correctly?"</p>
<p>The rest is refinement.</p>
