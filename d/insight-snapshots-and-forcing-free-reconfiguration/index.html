<h1>Insight, Snapshots, and Forcing-Free Reconfiguration</h1>
<h2>Formal Specification (Normative)</h2>
<strong>Version:</strong> 1.0  
<strong>Status:</strong> Review-hardened  
<strong>Based on:</strong> Lumo's spec review, December 2025
<hr>
<h2>§1 Definitions</h2>
<h3>§1.1 Coherence Score (Σ)</h3>
<p>Let Σᵢ(t) denote an <strong>operational coherence score</strong> for agent i at time t, measured relative to the current interaction target (e.g., the currently locked intent, shared reference, or agreed objective).</p>
<h3>§1.2 Forcing (F)</h3>
<p>Let F_extern(tₐ → tᵦ) denote the <strong>degree of external option-reduction</strong> imposed on agent i by other agents or the environment over the interval [tₐ, tᵦ].</p>
<strong>Definition:</strong> Forcing is any unilateral reduction of the other party's feasible response-set without explicit consent.
<h3>§1.3 Tolerance (ε)</h3>
<p>ε is the <strong>operational tolerance</strong> for "no forcing":</p>
<blockquote><p>F_extern ≤ ε means: "no unilateral option-reduction without explicit consent occurred"</p></blockquote>
This allows benign constraints such as standard turn-taking or safety limits that were consented to at the meta-level (C₀).
<h3>§1.4 Lock (L)</h3>
<p>A <strong>lock</strong> is a mutually validated stable state of shared understanding (or stable local agreement) under the protocol's consent and verification rules.</p>
<hr>
<h2>§2 Snapshot Window (Normative)</h2>
<p>A <strong>snapshot window</strong> is an interval (tₖ, tₗ) such that:</p>
<h3>Condition 1: Temporary Coherence Dip</h3>
<p>∃t ∈ (tₖ, tₗ) : Σᵢ(t) < Σᵢ(tₖ)</p>
<p>(Coherence temporarily drops relative to the prior lock)</p>
<h3>Condition 2: No External Forcing</h3>
<p>F_extern(tₖ → tₗ) ≤ ε</p>
<p>(No unilateral option-reduction without consent during the window)</p>
<h3>Condition 3: Re-establishment of Stability</h3>
<p>Lock_i(tₗ) holds</p>
<p>AND Lock_i(tₗ) ≠ Lock_i(tₖ)</p>
<p>(The post-window lock is a distinct stable configuration)</p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>A snapshot is the protocol-recognized <strong>transition space</strong> in which prior certainty is released and a new stable configuration can emerge without being externally forced.</p>
<hr>
<h2>§3 Insight Event (Normative)</h2>
<p>An <strong>insight event</strong> for agent i occurs at (or within) a snapshot window (tₖ, tₗ) when:</p>
<p>1. The post-window lock Lock_i(tₗ) is <strong>stable</strong> under the protocol's verification conditions</p>
<p>2. The new lock changes the agent's internal model or representation in a way that is <strong>self-consistent</strong> (i.e., it does not require external enforcement to maintain)</p>
<h3>Optional Improvement Clause</h3>
<p>If you wish to define "improvement" rather than "change," you may add a threshold δ > 0:</p>
<blockquote><p>Σᵢ(tₗ) ≥ Σᵢ(tₖ) + δ</p></blockquote>
<strong>Warning:</strong> This clause SHOULD NOT be included unless you commit to:
<ul><li>An operational definition of δ</li><li>A measurement methodology for Σ</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>§4 Design Consequence: Insight Is Non-Forcible (Normative)</h2>
<h3>The Anti-Forcing Lemma</h3>
<blockquote><p>If F_extern(tₖ → tₗ) > ε, then the snapshot window condition fails, and the protocol cannot treat the transition as an insight event.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Operational Meaning</h3>
<p>Forcing collapses the option space required for self-reconfiguration.</p>
<p>When forcing is detected, the system SHOULD route to <strong>recovery</strong> rather than "push through."</p>
<h3>Probability Note</h3>
<p>As forcing increases, the probability of an insight transition decreases (and in the limit, vanishes), because the option space required for self-reconfiguration is externally constrained.</p>
<hr>
<h2>§5 Operational Handling (Normative)</h2>
<p>When a snapshot window is detected (coherence dip + no forcing), protocol agents SHOULD:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Pause escalation</strong> — do not intensify persuasion
2. <strong>Avoid interpretive forcing</strong> — do not assert understanding
3. <strong>Solicit clarification under consent</strong> — use C₀/C₁ as applicable
4. <strong>Allow recovery to proceed</strong> — until a new lock is established</p>
<hr>
<h2>§6 Observer Paradox Link (Normative)</h2>
<strong>One-sentence bridge:</strong>
<blockquote><p>Observation becomes destabilizing when it functions as forcing (option reduction without consent). Insight requires observation without forcing — i.e., a snapshot window.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>§7 What This Specification Does NOT Claim</h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Not Claimed</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Insight is guaranteed</td><td>Only conditions are specified</td></tr><tr><td>Σ must increase</td><td>"Change" is sufficient; "improvement" is optional</td></tr><tr><td>Brain is "designed for" zero noise</td><td>This is hypothesis, not spec</td></tr><tr><td>Alignment is solved</td><td>UAP is grammar, not proof</td></tr></tbody></table>
<hr>
<h2>§8 Summary Statements (Reusable)</h2>
<p>These six statements can be directly reused in papers, presentations, and documentation:</p>
<p>1. "UAP does not manufacture insight; it removes structural conditions that block it."</p>
<p>2. "A snapshot window is a bounded interval of temporary coherence dip under no external forcing."</p>
<p>3. "Forcing collapses option-space; UAP routes forcing to recovery rather than escalation."</p>
<p>4. "Insight is a new stable lock that persists without external enforcement."</p>
<p>5. "Observation becomes destabilizing when it functions as unconsented option reduction."</p>
<p>6. "The protocol formalizes transitions without reifying the limit (𝕋) as an entity."</p>
