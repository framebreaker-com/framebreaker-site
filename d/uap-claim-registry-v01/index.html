<p># I. Meta, Scope, Positioning (1–12)</p>
<strong>C-001</strong> (Program statement)  
UAP is presented as operational grammar for voluntary coherence, not as ontology.  
<em>Scope:</em> public release  
<em>Falsifier:</em> text or notation that enforces ontological claims
<strong>C-002</strong> (Fact)  
UAP uses explicit gates: C₀ (meta-consent) and C₁ (content-consent).  
<em>Scope:</em> spec  
<em>Falsifier:</em> missing or inconsistent definitions
<strong>C-003</strong> (Fact)  
UAP contains verification (Σ), anti-forcing (F⁻), lock (L), recovery (R).  
<em>Scope:</em> spec  
<em>Falsifier:</em> missing or contradictory definitions
<strong>C-004</strong> (Inference)  
Without C₀, even a "friendly" question can have forcing effect (option reduction through framing).  
<em>Scope:</em> conversation  
<em>Falsifier:</em> formal counterexample where no option-reduction occurs without C₀
<strong>C-005</strong> (Program statement)  
UAP claims no "truth"; UAP claims procedural hygiene in interaction.  
<em>Scope:</em> paper  
<em>Falsifier:</em> passages positioning UAP as truth machine
<strong>C-006</strong> (Inference)  
UAP is self-applicable: applied to UAP itself doesn't require additional primitives.  
<em>Scope:</em> formal core  
<em>Falsifier:</em> necessary extra primitive to justify UAP steps
<strong>C-007</strong> (Program statement)  
"Perfect" means: internally consistent, minimal, closed under own rules.  
<em>Scope:</em> internal/paper  
<em>Falsifier:</em> ambiguous use of "perfect" as universal guarantee
<strong>C-008</strong> (Program statement)  
UAP is compatible with multiple normative frameworks but is not itself normative.  
<em>Scope:</em> governance  
<em>Falsifier:</em> UAP prescribes moral end-goals instead of procedure
<strong>C-009</strong> (Inference)  
UAP minimizes category errors through separation of formal/operational/poetic.  
<em>Scope:</em> doc structure  
<em>Falsifier:</em> definitions that use poetry as proof
<strong>C-010</strong> (Program statement)  
UAP aims for voluntary interaction; use as coercion mechanism is category error.  
<em>Scope:</em> deployment  
<em>Falsifier:</em> implementation pattern where UAP gates serve as coercion tool
<strong>C-011</strong> (Hypothesis)  
UAP is broadly applicable because primitives are domain-agnostic (consent/verification/recovery).  
<em>Scope:</em> cross-domain  
<em>Falsifier:</em> domain where primitives are structurally undefinable
<strong>C-012</strong> (Program statement)  
UAP documents must contain explicit Non-claims (no therapy, no legal compliance guarantee, no ontology).  
<em>Scope:</em> release  
<em>Falsifier:</em> absence of disclaimer section
<hr>
<p># II. Formal Layer, Limit Discipline, 𝕋 (13–22)</p>
<strong>C-013</strong> (Fact)  
𝕋 is a limit marker (stop sign), not an object/state in the model.  
<em>Scope:</em> formal spec  
<em>Falsifier:</em> 𝕋 receives properties as if it were a state
<strong>C-014</strong> (Inference)  
Any statement φ(𝕋) is by definition language-internal, describing the induced distinction, not 𝕋.  
<em>Scope:</em> paper  
<em>Falsifier:</em> consistent semantics where φ(𝕋) denotatively fixes 𝕋 without distinctions

"Deeper" doesn't mean more layers; it means less projection/forcing.  
<em>Scope:</em> interpretation  
<em>Falsifier:</em> necessity of extra ontological layer for UAP to work
<strong>C-016</strong> (Program statement)  
Limit paradox is used as hygiene lemma to block spec inflation.  
<em>Scope:</em> review

In perfect adherence, UAP is attractor-direction: necessity for new distinctions decreases.  
<em>Scope:</em> theory  
<em>Falsifier:</em> repeated application requires ever more primitives
<strong>C-018</strong> (Fact)  
UAP distinguishes: formal (definitions), operational (procedures), poetic (non-normative appendix).  
<em>Scope:</em> repo  
<em>Falsifier:</em> mixing without label
<strong>C-019</strong> (Hypothesis)  
"Reduction stability": re-derivation from different starting points converges to functionally equivalent core.  
<em>Scope:</em> empirical (runs)  
<em>Falsifier:</em> stable alternative core that better achieves same goals
<strong>C-020</strong> (Program statement)  
Claims about "monad/pre-monad" are used exclusively as limit-language, not as entity.  
<em>Scope:</em> release  
<em>Falsifier:</em> entity-ontology is introduced
<strong>C-021</strong> (Inference)  
UAP core can be formulated as minimal interaction: M := (B ↔ D).  
<em>Scope:</em> formal  
<em>Falsifier:</em> B↔D is derivable or replaceable by smaller primitive
<strong>C-022</strong> (Program statement)  
Any notation addition requires: new necessity + falsifier + backward-compatibility check.

<em>Falsifier:</em> notation grows without necessity
<hr>
<p># III. Consent, Forcing, Coherence, Recovery (23–38)</p>

<em>Scope:</em> human behavior  
<em>Falsifier:</em> context where C₁ makes no difference for lock quality
<strong>C-025</strong> (Inference)  
Forcing (F>0) can occur without aggression: time pressure, framing, implicit assumptions.

<strong>C-028</strong> (Inference)  
Recovery (R) is not "error"; it's part of normal flow in drift-rich environments.  
<em>Scope:</em> operations  
<em>Falsifier:</em> recovery correlates only with failure, never productive iteration
<strong>C-029</strong> (Fact)  
Lock (L) is an explicitly confirmed state: "yes, this is correct / we proceed with this."

"Do I understand you correctly?" is anti-forcing only when C₀ is present.  
<em>Scope:</em> meta-consent  
<em>Falsifier:</em> circumstances where that question is forcing-free without C₀

<em>Falsifier:</em> reduction increases ambiguity
<strong>C-050</strong> (Program statement)  
Insight section in paper must remain labeled as hypothesis + measurement plan.  
<em>Scope:</em> release

<em>Scope:</em> formal review  
<em>Falsifier:</em> self-application requires ontology
<strong>C-063</strong> (Hypothesis)

<hr>
<p># VIII. Security, Privacy, IAM, Zero-Trust (86–92)</p>

<hr>
<p># IX. Economics, Markets, Game Theory (93–97)</p>
