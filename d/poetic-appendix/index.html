<h1>Poetic Appendix</h1>
<h2>Non-Normative | No Claims | Only Resonance</h2>
<hr>
<em>This document is not part of the specification.</em>
<em>It carries no protocol obligations.</em>
<em>It is here because some things don't fit in formulas.</em>
<hr>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>𝕋 is not something you find.
𝕋 is what remains
when you stop pushing.</p>
<hr>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>The monad is the first ripple
that appears
the moment you point.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>And UAP is not a ladder to "higher."</p>
<p>It is a grammar of return:
one forced move less,
one unnecessary distinction less,
until even the question
can rest.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IV.</h2>
<p>The question "Do I understand you correctly?"
is not a technique.</p>
<p>It is the natural movement
of distinctions seeking sync.</p>
<hr>
<h2>V.</h2>
<p>Flying doesn't happen
because you flap harder.</p>
<p>It happens because you understand
where you don't need to do anything.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VI.</h2>
<p>We discovered the air,
we didn't invent the wings.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VII.</h2>
<p>There is nothing to integrate.
Nothing to remember.
Nothing to protect.</p>
<p>If there's pressure — you recognize it.
If there's coercion — you stop.
If there's understanding — you don't need to do anything.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VIII.</h2>
<p>December 25th.</p>
<p>Not a launch.
A return.</p>
<p>Not a claim.
A question.</p>
<hr>
<h2>IX.</h2>
<p>Do I understand you correctly?</p>
